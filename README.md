# dust
A lightweight search tool for finding SQA past papers.

---

Dust uses HTML & JavaScript and a little CSS to work. No information is sent to a server, nor do we own any of the papers. 

All resources link back to their original source, Dust simply provides an easy way to find and use these resources.
